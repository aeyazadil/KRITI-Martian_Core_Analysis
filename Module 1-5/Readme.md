# Martian Core Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the document **"Martian Core Analysis"**, which explores the seismic properties of Mars' interior using wave velocity equations, Snell's Law, and observational data. The document presents calculations, theoretical derivations, and seismic observations to analyze the core state of Mars.

## Contents
The document is structured into the following modules:

### **Module 1: Understanding Seismic Wave Velocities**
- Introduction to P-waves and S-waves
- Calculation of seismic wave velocities
- Derivation of wave equations in a homogeneous, isotropic medium

### **Module 2: Identifying Shadow Zones**
- Explanation of S-wave shadow zones
- Inference on the core's state based on seismic wave absence

### **Module 3: Calculating the Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB)**
- Application of Snellâ€™s Law to P-wave refraction
- Calculation of refraction angles based on given seismic data

### **Module 4: Determining Core Radius**
- Calculation of the Martian core radius using known planetary parameters
- Comparison of calculated values with seismic observations

### **Module 5: Verifying Core State**
- Seismic observations confirming a liquid Martian core
- Core composition and stratification
- Seismic velocity profiles and thermal dynamics
- Implications for Mars' magnetic field and planetary evolution
- Future research directions
